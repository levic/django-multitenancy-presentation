					<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
					<p class="fragment fade-in">We've using Django & PostgreSQL on our website.</p>
					<p class="fragment fade-in">How can we ensure users don't see data that doesn't belong to them?</p>
					<p class="fragment fade-in">"<em>Tenant</em>"?</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						[0-1min]
						- Particular focus: what can we do to ensure that developer mistakes don't allow data leakage?<br/>

						- What is a "tenant"? Account that has data that is logically isolated from others in the system
							- One example would be gmail where users should not be able to see mailboxes of other users even though
								using the same server resources
						- Not necessarily a user. Pretty common to have company accounts with multiple users where users
							can see all or some of the data only within that account. Examples would be Salesforce.

						<aside class="notes">
							When first start using django, start out by following tutorials & docs; they usually start with the vanilla django permission system<br/>
							Limited usefulness:<br/>
							- All permissions are global: a user either has them or they don't; can't restrict to a subset of records
							- Can't attach any logic to permissions which usually leads to code duplication
							- Clumsy to define permissions that aren't add/change/delete/view
							- Assumes permissions are linked to a model: what if you have eg a dashboard?
							- Permission assignments are stored in the database, not code
								- Needs migrations to change
								- Hard to properly test if you've allowed users to change permission

						<aside class="notes">
							- Fortunately django's permission system does actually support record-level permission
							- Unfortunately it's not something that django supports out of the box
								- To take advantage of it you have to configure an authentication backend

							- `rules` allows you to map a permission name to a python function and its structure encourages you to centralise all your permission checking logic
							- Creating your own AUTHENTICATION_BACKEND is surprisingly simple: `has_perm`
								- On previous projects for example I've used a permissions system that looks up permissions in a CSV file which is then used to invoke python functions.
									This  has the nice property that your product manager can easily see which user types have access to which permissions

							- One of the nice things about CBVs is that you can implement
								object-based permission checks in your base classes and then you
								get this throughout your site
								- Do want to be careful that if new developers don't accidentally
							    inherit from the vanilla django CBVs; if you've never used it
							    before then look up Django System Checks which will allow you
							    to run system check on startup so that you can be sure this
									didn't take place

							- isolation:
								- not just data but also performance (one big tenant doesn't affect others)<br/>
								- while costs are high overall, is easier to pass on costs to specific tenants<br/>
							- lots tenants:<br/>
								- becomes painful. need to stand up new app servers and databases.;<br/>
								- can be automated, but more moving parts is more things that can go wrong;<br/>
							- cross-tenancy
								- no easy way to run queries (like usage reports) that aggregate data from all tenancies <br/>
							- admin: how to take a DB snapshot when multiple databases?<br/>
							- deployments: have to roll out migrations & updates to each tenancy one at a time<br/>

							Usually this is a bad idea<br/>

							why mention this at all? can be a good idea if you have a small number of tenants.<br/>
							- I had a client whose CRM was written assuming  a single tenancy. When they decided to license it to

							- Again, majority of code can pretend that tenancies don't exist at all and it "just works";
							  because it's in the one database transactions will work without surprises<br/>
							- very large numbers of schemas:
								- when you try to run some pg tools (pg_dump, pg_restore) with default settings then you'll
							    run into postgres limitation (eg number of concurrent read locks)<br/>
							- Cross-Tenancy Queries: possible because the tables are all in the same database,
								however to make this actually happen you end up with giant SQL UNIONs<br/>
							- admin/deployment is better but there are still some limitations<br/>

							- transaction limits in postgres; if you try to modify too many tables in one transaction
									you will run into those limits, which causes issues with migratinos
								- if done without transactions then back to earlier problem where you might have migrations applied to
							    half of the system when something fails<br/>
							- if you've not used it before, connection pooling it's a way of sharing DB connections between requests.
								need to be careful that your setup doesn't allow interleaving of queries from simultaneous requests that
								may be using different schema<br/>

								  postgres optimiser is pretty good but more complicate queries
							    always run the risk that it will choose a bad query plan and
							    then you'll have to restructure your query;
							    most of the times if your code was already applying correct
							    tenancy filters then this shouldn't be an issue, and is a nice
							    backstop in case you've messed something up<br/>

							- depending on your postgres user permission (in particular superusers)
								they could bypass permission checks entirely, so make sure you test properly
								<br/>

							- if using postgres users for your RLS checks then make sure that
							  the user taking backups can actually see all rows or
							  you'll be very upset when you go to restore a backup<br/>

							In summary<br/>
							- Multiple app servers & databases are extremely simple but can be costly<br/>
							- Using a single database scales much better with number of tenants,<br/>
							  - Custom django managers/queryset can be used to standardise on tenancy filtering<br/>
							  - Denormalising tenancy data can simplify your code at the expense of larger tables/indexes and less flexibility<br/>
							  - Postgres row-level security checks can act as a nice failsafe<br/>
